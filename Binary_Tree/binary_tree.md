# Binary Tree

## Defining the Binary Tree

A Binary Tree can be defined as a tree data structure. Each parent node can have at maximum two children, and each node will have the dat It self and the address for the left and right children. 

A important aspect from a binary tree is the fact that the order of the children is important, because It change the result.
There are some kinds of binaries trees:

### Full Binary Tree

A full binary tree is a kind of binary tree which every single node has either two children or no children att all.

### Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is a type in which every internal node has two children and every leafs are at exact the same level.

### Perfect Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is similar to a full binary tree but the main differences are:

- Every level must be completed filled
- All leafs lean toward the left
- The last leaf might not have a right sibling, the same doesn't apply to the right leaf, that must have a left sibling

### Degenerate or Pathological Tree

Is a kind of tree that have a single children always.

### Balanced Binary Tree

It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
